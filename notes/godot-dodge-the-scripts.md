# Dodge the Creeps tutorial

### Initializing Project
- Downloaded assets from tutorial
- Create Project and changed Project Settings so that its viewport width is 480 and height is 720.
- Did Stretch for canvas_items and aspect keep
    - Apparently this ensures the game scales consistently on different sized screens

### Overview
- In this project we will make 3 independent scenes 
    - Player
    - Mob
    - HUD
- which we will then combine into the game's Main scene
